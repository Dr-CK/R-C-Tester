# R-C-Tester
 Resistance and capacitance meter with autoranging
 Christoffer Karlsson 2022

 Simple device for measuring resistor and capacitor values
 With auto-ranging, possibility of calibration over the Serial interface,
 and displaying measured values on a seven segment LED display.

 Resistance measurement by a simple voltage divider with a resistor ladder
 Capacitance measurement using the same resistor ladder and capturing
 time-dependent voltage.
